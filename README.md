Simplix - hacky and simple linux distro for embedded using Nix
==============================================

Done:
- Get WiFi and networking running
- Try to build distro using nix on host

Next steps:
- Other archs
- Simple status display using gpio leds
- Have an eye on kernel version (nix headers / glibc v. manually compiled kernel)

Ideas:
- Get minimal self-hosting linux running
- Test hw acceleration and other D1 features
- OTA updates of the root fs (maybe bluetooth) + get logs
